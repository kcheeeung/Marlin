# Marlin 3D Bioprinter Firmware 

## Bioprinting 
In collaboration with University of California, Berkeley and Lawerence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley Bioprinting plans to revolutionize the way researchers conduct studies by producing a 3D bioprinter capable of printing the cancer microenvironment, focusing especially on the vascularization of constructs. We plan to advance technological access and resources to researchers and students across the bay area and UC Berkeley. Our design philosophy and approach revolves around three basic principles of simplicity, elegance, functionality.

In this variant of the Marlin firmware, our modifications make it possible to reconfigure any Arduino based 3D printer board and transform it into a printer capable of bioprinting. Marlin 1.1.x represents an evolutionary leap over Marlin 1.0.2. It is the result of over two years of effort by several volunteers around the world who have paid meticulous and sometimes obsessive attention to every detail. For this release we focused on code quality, performance, stability, and overall user experience. Several new features have also been added, many of which require no extra hardware.

## License
Marlin is published under the GPL license because we believe in open development. The GPL comes with both rights and obligations. Whether you use Marlin firmware as the driver for your open or closed-source product, you must keep Marlin open, and you must provide your compatible Marlin source code to end users upon request. The most straightforward way to comply with the Marlin license is to make a fork of Marlin on Github, perform your modifications, and direct users to your modified fork.

While we can't prevent the use of this code in products (3D printers, CNC, etc.) that are closed source or crippled by a patent, we would prefer that you choose another firmware or, better yet, make your own.
